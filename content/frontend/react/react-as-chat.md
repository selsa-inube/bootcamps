# A6: Chat

## Assignment

1. The project is about creating the client of a chat app.
2. Only the user can post messages to the app, there is no receiver end.
3. The only interactions of the app are selecting a user to chat and posting a message to that chat. Do not add more functionality.
4. The app should be pixel perfect. This means, you must replicate the app as best as you can with all the styling you get to see in the design. Polish it.
5. [Mockups](./assets/chat-app.png)
