# A2: New York Times in React

Create a vite project and use the same mockup you used in the HTML-CSS module to create the New York Times page but using React instead.

**Requirements:**

1. You must use styled-components to create your components.
2. App.js cannot have any HTMLElement in its return statement. Everything in that return statement should be a React component.
