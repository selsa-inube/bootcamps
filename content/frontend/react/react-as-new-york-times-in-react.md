# New York Times in React

## Assignment

Create a vite project and use the same mockup you used in the HTML-CSS module to create the New York Times page but using React instead.

## Requirements

1. You must use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to create your components.
2. App.js cannot have any HTMLElement in its return statement. Everything in that return statement should be a React component.
