# A18: Calendar

Create the next mockup.

1. You don’t have to create the sidebar.
2. The buttons to scroll through dates aren’t interactive.
3. You don’t have to offer a way to create meetings.
4. When hovering a card, it should move up and left and be on top of the elements.
5. Each row in the table is an interval of an hour (the image doesn’t respect that).
