# A1: freeCodeCamp â†’ Basic HTML and HTML5

The freeCodeCamp platform provides the Legacy Responsive Web Design Certification in which the vary basic elements of HTML are taught. The assignment consist in fulfilling all the exercises within the Basic HTML and HTML5 module of this certification.

ðŸ’¡ **Suggestion:** The site has internationalization, so you can complete the module in Spanish. Nonetheless, I suggest you to try the English version since this is the language that almost all the materials we will be studying use.
