# A23: Stella Studio

Develop the mockup for the following page of Stella Studio.

Take into account:

1. The image shows a desktop mockup and two mobile mockups, the idea is to develop the desktop mockup and **only** the first mobile mockup.
2. You can replace the staircase photo with any photo you want.
