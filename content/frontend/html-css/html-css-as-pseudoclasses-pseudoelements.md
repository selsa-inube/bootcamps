# A5: Pseudoclasses and pseudoelements in a form

Create a page where:

1. There is a form that will enable the user to suscribe to a newsletter.
2. All the form texts are defined in rem.
3. The user must enter his/her name (required).
4. The user must enter his/her email (required).
5. The user should enter his/her phone number (optional).
6. Don’t use labels, use placeholders for the inputs.
7. The user must accept the “Terms and Conditions” checkbox.
8. The user should know if an input is incorrect before hitting the Subscribe button. Both with color and text.
9. The “Terms and Conditions” text must be a link to a section below the form where the user can read its content.
   1. The content must be colored with a light blue background color (#DEEBFF) when the URL goes to the #terms-and-conditions section.
   2. The first paragraph of this section must have a dark blue font color (#0747A6).
   3. The section must include an unordered list with 10 items where the bullets are replaced by some other icon (not the bullet point).
   4. For each odd element, the icon must be colored in gray (#5E6C84).
   5. The section must have a max-width of 120 characters and the text must be centered.
10. The “Terms and Conditions” must have different look and feel for the link, visited, hover and active states.

💡 This is a dummy site, the text doesn’t have to be real. You can use lorem ipsum to generate the Terms and Conditions section.
