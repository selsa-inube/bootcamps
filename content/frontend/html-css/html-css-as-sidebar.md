# A17: Sidebar

Create the minified sidebar that is presented in the next image.

1. This means, that you must create the version of the sidebar that is in the right of the image (where you only display the icons and on hover show the label).
2. When you hover over the top blue logo, you must show the 4 brands and allow the user to hover over them (clicking them should be useless).
3. When you hover over the avatar at the bottom, the profile menu should appear and allow the user to hover over the options (Clicking them should be useless).
4. The sidebar should be in the left side of the page. The page should have a height of 200vh and even when scrolling down the sidebar should remain fixed on the left.

**Get the icons and logos on the internet (any logo is useful, you donâ€™t need to use the exact same logos).**
