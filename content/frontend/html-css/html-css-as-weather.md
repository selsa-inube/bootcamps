# A31: Weather

Create the next mockup of a weather mobile app:

1. The app should start by displaying the image at the left.
2. The cards with the weather per hour should change to blue when hovered.
3. When the user clicks in the “7 days” button, the app should navigate to the page on the right.
4. You can go back to the home page using the < icon in the right image.
5. You can get weather icons from here: https://fontawesome.com/search?c=weather&o=r
