Create an HTML Document linked to a CSS Spreadsheet that presents the information provided by EY using all CSS Selectors available except: classes and ids.

**The objective isnâ€™t to create a high-fidelity copy of the site, but to create a site that kind of shows the information following the basic design of the article.**

[Sustentabilidad y cuidado del planeta: prioridades del consumo](https://www.ey.com/es_co/consumer-products-retail/sustentabilidad-cuidado-planeta-prioridades-consumo)

1. Focus solely on the main section of the article.
2. Do not take into account the full wide image at the top of the page.
3. Do not take into account the metadata column on the left where you see the Authors, Published Date and Social Media links.
4. Do not try to make animations.
5. Do not try to create charts with pie to show percentages. Show the numbers.
