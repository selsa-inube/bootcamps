# Minmax

## Assignment

Create a program that asks the user about a minimum value, a maximum value and a list of values. After that, filter out all the values that are out of range and print the values in range using a slice.

## Conditions

1. All values must be obtained from the user through the command-line in runtime (don't use os.Args)
2. You can ask an input from the user three times maximum.
3. Don't use packages or modules, all the code must be inside a single file (package main).
4. Your solution must have a `func minmax()`. That function must have three parameters: `min`, `max`, and `values`. It must return a slice of float64 numbers. The values parameter should be variadic.
5. Your solution must have a `func getInput()` whose only purpose is to get input from the user. It returns a string with the whole user input.
6. Apart from the mandatory `minmax()` and `getInput()` functions, you can create as many more functions as you need.
7. When printing the result in the terminal, the value printed must be an slice.
