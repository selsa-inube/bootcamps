# Marshall and Unmarshall

This lecture is actually two lectures in one. Both related with the Marshalling process and its application in Go.

- Lecture 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)
- Lecture 2: https://withcodeexample.com/the-art-of-marshal-and-unmarshal-in-go/

> [!NOTE]
> These lectures don't have a quiz.
> In the Wikipedia article we're interested only in the "intro" and the "Comparison with serialization" sections (the first two sections).
