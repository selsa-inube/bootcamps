# Testing - MinMax

## Assignment

This assignment is about testing the [minmax](./go-as-minmax.md) function you created previously.

Create a testing file and test at least the following scenarios:

1. What should happen if you correctly pass a min, a max and a set of values?
2. What should happen if the you just pass a min, a max and a single value?
3. What should happen if the value passed as min is actually greater than max?
4. What should happen if not a single value passed is within the range?
5. What should happen if both min and max are negative?
6. What should happen if both min and max are equal?
