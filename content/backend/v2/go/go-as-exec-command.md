# Exec Command

## Situation

This assignment will let you know and work with the `exec.Command()` function that is exported from the `exec` package. You'll work as well with the `io.Writer` interface and `stdout` and `stderr`.

## Assignment

You will use this article as a reference. The idea is that you try the different exercises the article presents so you can read and practice some variants when using `exec.Command()`.

###Â Exercises and Commits

When you create your Pull Request, it is expected that your branch has one commit per exercise. The list of exercises to send are:

1. Running a command
2. Running a command and showing output
3. Running a command and capturing the output
4. Behind the scenes of `CombinedOutput()`
5. Capture stderr and stdout separately
6. Capture output but also show progress on stdout

> [!NOTE]
> The article has some more steps, but they are not required for this assignment.

### Result

The pull request will have the solution for the last exercise and the 6 commits. One per exercise.
