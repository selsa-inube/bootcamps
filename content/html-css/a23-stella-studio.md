# A23: Stella Studio

Develop the mockup for the following page of Stella Studio.

Take into account:

1. The image shows a desktop mockup and two mobile mockups, the idea is to develop the desktop mockup and **only** the first mobile mockup.
2. The staircase photo that we will use is stored in the repository.
