          In “Severance,” Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon
          Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure,
          which surgically divides their memories between their work and
          personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is
          called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an
          unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of
          his work… and of himself.
        </p>

          Chris Black, John Cameron, and Andrew Colville are executive producers

        <p>
          Jason Sudeikis is Ted Lasso, an American football coach hired to
          manage a British soccer team — despite having no experience. But what
          he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for with optimism, underdog
          determination — and biscuits. The widely acclaimed series also stars
          Hannah Waddingham, Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Juno Temple, Brett
          Goldstein, Phil Dunster, and Nick Mohammed.
        </p>
        <p>

          Studio Group. Doozer’s Jeff Ingold also serves as an executive
          producer, with Liza Katzer as co-executive producer. The series was
          developed by Sudeikis, Lawrence, Brendan Hunt, and Joe Kelly, and is
          based on the preexisting format and characters from NBC Sports.
