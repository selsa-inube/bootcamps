      <p>React is a JavaScript library for building</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Declarative:</strong> React makes it painless to create
          interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
          application, and React will efficiently update and render just the
          right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your
          code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Component-Based:</strong> Build encapsulated components that
          manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since
          component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can
          easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the
          DOM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere:</strong> We don't make assumptions
          about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new
          features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also
          render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using
          <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>.

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <hr />
    <div>
      <p>
        React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and
        <strong>you can use as little or as much React as you need:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can use React as a script tag from a
        <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html">CDN</a>, or as
        a react package on
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">npm</a>.

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <hr />
      <p>
        We have several examples
        <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev">on the website</a>. Here
        is the first one to get you started:
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>
          import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";<br /><br /><br />
          function HelloMessage({ name }) {<br /><br />
          return "div" Hello {name} /"div";<br />
          }<br /><br /><br /><br />
          const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));<br /><br />
          root.render( HelloMessage name="Taylor" );
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax;
        <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html"
          >we call it JSX</a
        >. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable,
        and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a
        "script" tag, read
        <a
          href="https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project#optional-try-react-with-jsx"
          >this section</a
        >
        on integrating JSX; otherwise, the
        <a href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project"
          >recommended JavaScript toolchains</a
        >
        handle it automatically.
